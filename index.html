        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer.  I am hoping to gain the skills and credentials to become a Software Engineer by 
            enrolling in the Flatiron School Software Engineering Bootcamp.  My background is in Chemical Engineering, and I have 
            9 years of work experience as a Chemical Engineer.  My job roles have largely been focused as being a Process Engineer 
            or as a Process Safety Engineer.
