        <h3>Bio/About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm an aspiring Software Engineer.  I am hoping to gain the skills and credentials to become a Software Engineer by 
            enrolling in the Flatiron School Software Engineering Bootcamp.  My background is in Chemical Engineering, and I have 
            9 years of work experience as a Chemical Engineer.  My job roles have largely involved support as a Process Engineer 
            and as a Process Safety Engineer.  
        </p>

        <p>Some of my hobbies include playing sports, hiking, reading books, and listening to music/podcasts.</p>
